# Curl-Tracker

A machine learning application that uses a Linear Support Vector Classification Model to track the number of bicep curls done by a user. Users get to train the model based on their own pictures of curl extensions and contractions. Constructed a GUI that allows users to see themselves, capture pictures of extensions and contractions separately and train the model. A minimum of 150-180 pictures of each is recommended for the model to provide optimum results. The pictures must contain good form and should be consistent.
